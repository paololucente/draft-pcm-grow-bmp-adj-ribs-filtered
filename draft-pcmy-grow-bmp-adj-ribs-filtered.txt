         Filtering Adj-Rib-In and Adj-Rib-Out to BMP receivers
                draft-pcmy-grow-bmp-adj-ribs-filtered-00

Abstract

   Filtering RIBs in BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) can be desirable for
   several use-cases like, for example, limiting the amount of data a
   collector station has to process or allow a sender to export only a
   certain afi/safi of interest.  This document defines a light way to
   inform a collector station that a Adj-Rib-In / Adj-Rib-Out data feed
   is being filtered.

1.  Introduction

   While RFC9069 [RFC9069] does define a light way to mark a Loc-Rib as
   filtered, there is no equivalent mechanism for Adj-Rib-In RFC7854
   [RFC7854] and Adj-Rib-Out RFC8671 [RFC8671].  This can be easily
   addressed through the introduction of a Peer F Flag in the "BMP Peer
   Flags for Peer Types 0 through 2" registry.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  Filtered RIB Flag

   As a recap, a BMP session is regarded as carrying Adj-Rib-In by
   defining the Peer Type to 0, 1 or 2 values and setting the O flag to
   zero (0) in the BMP Peer Flags (for Peer Types 0 through 2) registry.
   Similarly, Adj-Rib-Out is set by defining the Peer Type to 0, 1 or 2
   values and setting the O flag to one (1) in the BMP Peer Flags (for
   Peer Types 0 through 2) registry.  Both Adj-Rib-In and Adj-Rib-Out
   can be further defined as Pre-Policy, setting the Peer L Flag to zero
   (0), or Post-Policy, setting the Peer L Flag to one (1).

Internet-Draft   Filtering Adj-Rib-In and Adj-Rib-Out to       July 2024


   For both Adj-Rib-In and Adj-Rib-Out, for both Pre-Policy and Post-
   Policy cases, a new Peer F Flag is defined in the "BMP Peer Flags for
   Peer Types 0 through 2" registry.  If the RIB was filtered, the flag
   MUST be set to one (1).

   In Stats messages, counts MUST reflect the filtered RIB numbers and
   not the original RIB ones.

   Also should any characteristic of the filtering change, the sender
   MUST trigger a Peer Down then followed by a new Peer Up.

4.  Operational Considerations

   It is recommended that when filtering RIBs, the VRF/Table Name TLV -
   as defined in RFC9069 [RFC9069], TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring
   and Peer Down Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and BMP Peer Up
   Namespace [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up] - is specified to a meaningful
   string that can help discriminate the nature of filtering.

   The VRF/Table Name TLV can be either set in the Peer Up message, so
   to implicitely apply to all NLRIs received by the peer, or set via a
   Group TLV in Route Monitoring messages, to esplicitely apply to all
   NLRIs in the group.  Going down the Peer Up model is certainly
   optimal on the wire and simplifies packing at the sender side; going
   down the Route Monitoring model, instead, allows the receiver side to
   operate non-contextually (ie.  no need to look back at the Peer Up to
   make due associations).

5.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document asks IANA to add a new F Flag to the "BMP Peer Flags
   for Peer Types 0 through 2" registry.  The recommended value for the
   registry is 4.
