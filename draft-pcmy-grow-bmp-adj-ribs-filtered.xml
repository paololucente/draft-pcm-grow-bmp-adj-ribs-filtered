        <abstract>
            <t>
		Filtering RIBs in BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) can be desirable
		for several use-cases like, for example, limiting the amount of
		data a collector station has to process or allow a sender to export
		only a certain afi/safi of interest. This document defines a light
		way to inform a collector station that a Adj-Rib-In / Adj-Rib-Out
		data feed is being filtered.  
            </t>

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="Introduction">
            <t>
		While <xref target="RFC9069">RFC9069</xref> does define a light
		way to mark a Loc-Rib as filtered, there is no equivalent mechanism
		for Adj-Rib-In <xref target="RFC7854">RFC7854</xref> and Adj-Rib-Out
		<xref target="RFC8671">RFC8671</xref>. This can be easily addressed
		through the introduction of a Peer F Flag in the "BMP Peer Flags for
		Peer Types 0 through 2" registry.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Terminology">
            <t>
		The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
		NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
		"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
		described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>
		<xref target="RFC8174">RFC 8174</xref> when, and only when, they
		appear in all capitals, as shown here.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Filtered RIB Flag">
            <t>
		As a recap, a BMP session is regarded as carrying Adj-Rib-In by defining
		the Peer Type to 0, 1 or 2 values and setting the O flag to zero (0) in
		the BMP Peer Flags (for Peer Types 0 through 2) registry. Similarly,
		Adj-Rib-Out is set by defining the Peer Type to 0, 1 or 2 values and
		setting the O flag to one (1) in the BMP Peer Flags (for Peer Types 0
		through 2) registry. Both Adj-Rib-In and Adj-Rib-Out can be further
		defined as Pre-Policy, setting the Peer L Flag to zero (0), or Post-Policy,
		setting the Peer L Flag to one (1).
            </t>
	    <t>
		For both Adj-Rib-In and Adj-Rib-Out, for both Pre-Policy and Post-Policy
		cases, a new Peer F Flag is defined in the "BMP Peer Flags for Peer Types
		0 through 2" registry. If the RIB was filtered, the flag MUST be set to
		one (1).
	    </t>
	    <t>
		In Stats messages, counts MUST reflect the filtered RIB numbers and not
		the original RIB ones. 
	    </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Operational Considerations">
            <t>
		It is recommended that when filtering RIBs, the VRF/Table Name TLV - as
		defined in <xref target="RFC9069">RFC9069</xref>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv">
		TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer Down Messages</xref> and
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up">BMP Peer Up Namespace</xref> -
		is specified to a meaningful string that can help discriminate the
		nature of filtering. 
            </t>
            <t>
		The VRF/Table Name TLV can be either set in the Peer Up message, so to
		implicitely apply to all NLRIs received by the peer, or set via a Group
		TLV in Route Monitoring messages, to esplicitely apply to all NLRIs in
		the group. Going down the Peer Up model is certainly optimal on the wire
		and simplifies packing at the sender side; going down the Route Monitoring
		model, instead, allows the receiver side to operate non-contextually (ie.
		no need to look back at the Peer Up to make due associations). 
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
		It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
		considerations.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="IANA Considerations">
            <t>
		This document asks IANA to add a new F Flag to the "BMP Peer Flags for
		Peer Types 0 through 2" registry. The recommended value for the registry
		is 4.
